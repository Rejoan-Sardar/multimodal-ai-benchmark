# Multimodal AI Benchmark Platform Documentation

## Overview

This platform allows for comprehensive evaluation and comparison of multimodal AI models (mainly focusing on Google's Gemini and OpenAI's GPT models) across various tasks and modalities. The benchmarking system supports:

- Text generation and comprehension
- Image analysis and generation
- Video understanding
- Audio processing
- Multimodal interactions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. API keys for the models you want to evaluate:
   - Google API Key for Gemini models
   - OpenAI API Key for GPT and DALL-E models

2. Supported file formats:
   - Text: .txt, .md, .json
   - Images: .jpg, .jpeg, .png
   - Video: .mp4, .mov, .avi
   - Audio: .mp3, .wav, .m4a

### Setting Up API Keys

API keys should be set as environment variables:
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` for Gemini models
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` for OpenAI models

## Platform Features

### 1. Main Dashboard

The main dashboard provides an overview of available benchmarks and recent evaluation results.

### 2. Create Custom Benchmarks

The platform allows you to create custom benchmarks with specific:
- Task descriptions
- Input data
- Expected outputs
- Evaluation metrics

Custom benchmarks can be saved, edited, and shared.

### 3. Open Source Benchmarks

Run your models against established open-source benchmarks to compare performance with publicly available results.

### 4. Model Comparison

Directly compare multiple models on the same tasks with visualization of:
- Performance metrics
- Response time
- Output quality

## Evaluation Metrics

The platform supports multiple evaluation metrics including:

### General Metrics
- Accuracy
- Relevance
- Hallucination rate
- Response time

### Modality-Specific Metrics
- **Text:** Coherence, creativity, factual correctness
- **Image:** Detail level, object recognition accuracy
- **Video:** Temporal coherence, scene understanding
- **Audio:** Transcription accuracy, emotion recognition

## Benchmark Types

### Text Benchmarks
- General Knowledge Q&A
- Code Completion
- Creative Writing
- Research Capabilities
- Logical Reasoning

### Image Benchmarks
- Object Recognition
- Visual Reasoning
- Chart and Graph Analysis

### Video Benchmarks
- Scene Understanding
- Action Recognition

### Audio Benchmarks
- Speech Understanding
- Emotion Recognition

### Multimodal Benchmarks
- Image Captioning
- Visual Question Answering

## Creating Custom Benchmarks

Follow these steps to create a custom benchmark:

1. Navigate to the "Create Benchmark" page
2. Fill in benchmark details:
   - Name
   - Description
   - Modality type
   - Metrics for evaluation
3. Add tasks with:
   - Input prompts
   - Expected outputs (for objective metrics)
   - Evaluation criteria
4. Save and run with selected models

## Running Benchmarks

1. Select one or more models to evaluate
2. Choose a benchmark type or specific tasks
3. Configure evaluation settings
4. Run the benchmark
5. View and analyze results through provided visualizations

## Visualization Options

The platform offers various visualization methods:
- Bar charts for direct metric comparisons
- Radar charts for multi-metric visualization
- Line charts for performance over time
- Distribution plots for metric variability

## Performance Data Export

Evaluation results can be exported in multiple formats:
- JSON
- CSV
- PDF reports

## Advanced Features

### Custom Metric Creation
Define your own evaluation metrics based on specific requirements.

### Benchmark Sharing
Share custom benchmarks with the community.

### Performance Tracking
Track model performance over time as new versions are released.

## JSON Benchmark Format

Custom benchmarks follow this format:

```json
{
  "id": "benchmark-id",
  "name": "Benchmark Name",
  "type": "text|image|video|audio|multimodal",
  "description": "Detailed description",
  "metrics": ["metric1", "metric2"],
  "tasks": [
    {
      "input": "Task prompt or description",
      "expected_output": "Expected response or output criteria"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Best Practices

### For Accurate Benchmarking
1. Design diverse and representative tasks
2. Use consistent evaluation criteria
3. Include both easy and challenging examples
4. Consider multiple metrics for holistic evaluation
5. Run multiple trials for statistical significance

### For Custom Benchmarks
1. Clearly define expected outputs
2. Provide comprehensive instructions
3. Consider edge cases
4. Validate benchmark with multiple users/models
5. Document benchmark assumptions and limitations

## Known Limitations

1. Subjective metrics require human evaluation
2. Performance may vary with API versions
3. Token/request limits may affect certain benchmarks
4. Complex multimodal tasks may have inconsistent evaluation metrics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Connection Errors**
   - Verify API key validity
   - Check internet connection
   - Ensure API rate limits haven't been exceeded

2. **File Upload Issues**
   - Verify file format is supported
   - Check file size is within limits
   - Ensure file isn't corrupted

3. **Visualization Problems**
   - Try refreshing the page
   - Check if data format is correct
   - Verify metric fields exist in output data

## Contributing

To contribute additional benchmarks or features:

1. Follow the JSON benchmark format
2. Ensure comprehensive documentation
3. Include sample inputs and expected outputs
4. Submit via the platform's sharing feature
