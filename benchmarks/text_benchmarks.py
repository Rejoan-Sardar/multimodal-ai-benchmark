            "input": "Scientists have discovered a new species of deep-sea fish that can survive the crushing pressures of the Mariana Trench, the deepest part of the world's oceans. The fish, dubbed the 'Mariana snailfish,' has several adaptations that allow it to live at depths of up to 8,000 meters (26,200 feet) below the surface. Its body contains a special protein that prevents the collapse of crucial cell components under extreme pressure. Additionally, it has developed a unique metabolism that functions with minimal oxygen. The discovery challenges previous assumptions about the limits of vertebrate life and opens new avenues for research into adaptations to extreme environments. Researchers from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution suggest that studying these adaptations could have applications in various fields, including medicine and materials science.",
